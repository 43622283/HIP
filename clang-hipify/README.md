## Using hipify-clang

`hipify-clang` is a clang-based tool which can automate the translation of CUDA source code into portable HIP C++.
The tool can automatically add extra HIP arguments (notably the "hipLaunchParm" required at the beginning of every HIP kernel call).
`hipify-clang` has some additional dependencies explained below and can be built as a separate make step. The instructions below are specifically for **Ubuntu 14.04**

### Build and install

- Download and unpack clang+llvm 3.8 binary package preqrequisite.
```shell
wget http://llvm.org/releases/3.8.0/clang+llvm-3.8.0-x86_64-linux-gnu-ubuntu-14.04.tar.xz
tar xvfJ clang+llvm-3.8.0-x86_64-linux-gnu-ubuntu-14.04.tar.xz
```

- Enable build of hipify-clang and specify path to LLVM.

Note LLVM_DIR must be a full absolute path to the location extracted above. Here's an example assuming we extract the clang 3.8 package into ~/HIP/clang+llvm-3.8.0-x86_64-linux-gnu-ubuntu-14.04/
```shell
cd HIP
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DBUILD_CLANG_HIPIFY=1 -DLLVM_DIR=~/HIP/clang+llvm-3.8.0-x86_64-linux-gnu-ubuntu-14.04/ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make
make install
```

### Running and using hipify-clang

`hipify-clang` performs an initial compile of the CUDA source code into a "symbol tree", and thus needs access to the appropriate header files.

In the case when `hipify-clang` doesn't find cuda headers, it reports various errors about unknown keywords (e.g. '\__global\__'), API function names (e.g. 'cudaMalloc'), syntax (e.g. 'foo<<<1,n>>>(...)'), etc.

To install CUDA headers, download the "deb(network)" variant of the target installer from https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads. The commands below show how to download and install a recent version from http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu1404/x86_64/cuda-repo-ubuntu1404_7.5-18_amd64.deb.
```shell
wget http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu1404/x86_64/cuda-repo-ubuntu1404_7.5-18_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-ubuntu1404_7.5-18_amd64.deb
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install cuda-minimal-build-7-5 cuda-curand-dev-7-5
```
